# Pool

Allo distributes funds in pools, where each fund is owned by an identity in the
[registry](/overview/project-registry) and has an [allocation
strategy](/overview/allocation-strategy) that determines how the funds are
distributed.

For example, if a DAO wanted to hold a quarterly vote to distribute some of its
treasury among community projects, then it would create a new pool each quarter.
Projects, represented by identities in the registry, apply to receive funding
from the quarterly pool. The allocation strategy determines who is eligible to
receive funding, who can vote, and how funds are allocated and distributed.
