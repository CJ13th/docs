# Getting Involved

Thank you for your desire to contribute to Allo!

Below you will find some ways to help, but please don't feel limited by them. If
you have any other ideas, pop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gitcoin).

## Building

Building on top of the protocol is a great way to get involved and contribute to the ecosystem.

One easy way to get involved is to create your own [allocation strategy](). The
pieces of an allocation strategy give you a lot of room to explore and play
around with different mechanisms.

Another way to contribute to the Allo ecosystem is to build new tools (front
ends, apps, products, etc) for communities to allocate capital. Allo Protocol
serves as the base-layer, but we need devs like you to build interesting
products on top of it!

If you have other ideas and want help on how to build them, introduce yourself
in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gitcoin) in the
`ðŸ› allo-protocol-builders` channel.
