# Project Registry

The project registry is a universal, onchain registry of anyone receiving or
distributing capital through Allo. Once registered, an identity can create pools
of funding tied to that identity or apply to receive funding from another pool
in Allo. Identities in the registry can do either and we imagine some identities
will do both.

The goal of the Registry to is help projects accrue reputation and easily find
new sources of funding or to distribute capital to meaningful projects.

## Project Identities

When a project registers, it is given a unique address that it can use to
represent itself onchain. This address can be used for many things, including:

* Receiving funds distributed through an allocation strategy
* Be the subject of an attestation (i.e. attesting to the project managers having been KYC'ed)
* Hold an Soul-bound Token demonstrating that the project is a member of a larger community, like a DAO

Because projects are represented by addresses, allocation strategies can include
automated eligibility checks - like checking that the balance of SBT.
