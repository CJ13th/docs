# Conceptual Overview

### System Overview

<Image src="/allo-protocol-diagrams.png" alt="Architecture diagram of the Allo Protocol" width={800} height={500}/>

Allo Protocol is made up of the following components:

* A [**Project Registry**](project-registry/). This is a universal, on-chain registry of projects. Once listed in the registry, projects can apply to participate in grant rounds.
* [**Programs**](program.md). Each grant-giving organization will have an on-chain program, which manages it's rounds. Gitcoin is a program which hosts regular rounds, for example.
* [**Rounds**](round.md). A matching pool that is distributed based on a custom [**voting strategy**](voting-strategy/) and [**payout strategy**](payout-strategy/).

Each of these is explained further in the next sections of the documentation.
