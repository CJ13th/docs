# Introduction 

Allo uses a single strategy contract to handle all logic around recipients,
allocations, and token distribution. Developers can choose to create a custom
strategy or clone an existing one. Allo provides a `BaseStrategy` that all
strategies should inherit from. For more information, see the [Writing a Custom
Strategy](/strategies/writing-a-custom-strategy) page. Strategies must be
deployed prior to creating a new pool.

To help illustrate strategy concepts, this documentation will refer to the
[`DonationVotingStrategy.sol`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/tree/main/contracts/strategies/donation-voting)
strategy as an example. 

### Recipients

Recipients refer to groups or individuals who can receive allocations from the
pool. Strategy logic determines how eligible recipients are identified and
registered.

At a minimum, the recipient logic should consider:

* How recipient eligibility is determined
* What statuses a recipient may need to go through when registering
* How recipients will be identified
* Any additional data that is required for a recipient to be registered and eventually receive funds

The `registerRecipient` function is inherited from the
`BaseStrategy.sol` contract and needs to be completed in a custom strategy.

In the `DonationVotingStrategy.sol` example, recipients are identified by
their wallet address and are required to submit an application that is then
reviewed by the pool manager. Applications are only accepted during a specified
time period. Upon submission, the recipient is in a 'Pending' status, and after
review are either 'Accepted' or 'Rejected'.

### Allocations

Allocation logic determines how and when allocators can express opinions about
distributing the pool's funds to recipients. Allocators are wallet addresses
that are able to utilize the `allocate` function. Each strategy will need to
determine what makes a wallet eligible to be an allocator. Allocation can be as
complex or simple as needed for a given strategy. 

Some common considerations include:

* Is there a certain time period allocation can occur during?
* Can an allocator allocate multiple times?
* Does allocation require funds to be sent, and if so where are they stored?

The `DonationVotingStrategy.sol` contract marks all addresses as eligible
and they may allocate multiple times. Allocation involves donating pre-approved
tokens to the recipient. Allocation can only occur during a specified allocation
window.

### Token Distribution

Finally, strategies need to determine how payouts are handled for recipients. 

Payout logic may include:

* Calculating payout amounts
* Determining when and how often payouts occur
* Ensuring payout eligibility and accuracy
* Managing who can initiate a payout

Payouts are handled through the `distribute` function.

The `DonationVotingStrategy.sol` contract allows anyone to distribute funds,
as long as a pool manager has determined the funds are ready for payout. It also
includes the capability to reclaim undistributed funds 30 days after allocation
has ended. 

### Strategy Library

The [Strategy
Library](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/tree/main/contracts/strategies)
includes a variety of strategy contracts. These contracts can be used as is or
as a starting point for a custom strategy.
