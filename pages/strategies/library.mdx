# Strategy Library

The Allo core team and developer community have built out a library of example
allocation strategies. These strategies are a good way to learn how to write
a strategy, including some of the best practices for doing so. They should also
give you a taste of what's possible in an allocation strategy.

<Callout type="error" emoji="ðŸš©">
  Not all of the strategies in the library have been audited and some of them
  are meant purely as proofs of concept.

  Always have a contract audited before deploying it to mainnet.
