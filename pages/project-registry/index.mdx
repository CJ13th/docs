# Introduction
The [Allo v2 Project Registry] (https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/main/contracts/core/Registry.sol) is intended to be used as a resource for all Allo participants. Registry data can be used to establish trust between parties, build new tools, or offer insights into the ecosystem.

The core component of the registry is the profile. Profiles contain information about groups and individuals who wish to be part of the Allo ecosystem. Once a profile has been created, it can be used to run or participate in pools. 
All registry data, including profiles and event details, are stored on-chain and can be accessed through an [Allo subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/BQXTJRLZi7NWGq5AXzQQxvYNa5i1HmqALEJwy3gGJHCr?view=Overview&chain=mainnet).


## Building on the Project Registry
The registry also offers builders the chance to create tooling for the Allo ecosystem. 
Some examples of what registry data could be used to create include:
* Dashboards visualizing Allo data
* Incentive programs based on Allo events
* Targeted recruitment for pools

## Profile information
Each profile on the registry contains the following details:
* Id
* Name
* Metadata
* Owner address
* Array of member addresses

These details can be set when the profile is created using the createProfile function.
They can be updated by the profile owner using the updateProfileName, updateProfileMetadata, updateProfilePendingOwner, acceptProfileOwnership,  and addMembers functions.

## Project Registry Location
Project Registry is deployed on several chains. To add a profile, interact with the contract on your chosen chain.
