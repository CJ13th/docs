## Updating a Profile

## Allo V2 Subgraph

Project registry data is publicly available through [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/allo-protocol/allo-v2-goerli). Currently only Goerli data has been deployed.

## Reading Project Registry Data Using The Graph

Subgraph data can be accessed either manually through the subgraph Playground,
or programmatically through The Graph API. For more information about how to set
up these methods, please see the [Querying the
Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/querying-the-graph/) page in The
Graph documentation.

If you would like to display Project Registry data in another app, see The Graph
article on [Querying from an
Application](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/querying-from-an-application/).

## Query Structure

Below is a JSON structure of available query fields for the Allo Project
Registry.

Queries can be built through The Graph playground.
