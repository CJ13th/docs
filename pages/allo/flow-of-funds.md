# Flow of Funds

- How funds flow through Allo:
  - aqueduct --> pool --> strategy
  - allocation and distribution of funds are determined by the strategy
- Ideal is:
  - community (DAO, protocol, etc) sets up an aqueduct for running rounds on Allo
  - community runs a round, investing/granting in projects that will drive traffic/volume
  - protocol fee goes into the aqueduct, kicking of more rounds
