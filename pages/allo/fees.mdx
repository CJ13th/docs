# Fees
Allo collects a fee on each pool that is created through the protocol. There 
are two fee mechanisms, a base fee and a percentage fee.

### Base Fee
The base fee is a fixed amount that is charged when a pool is created. The base
fee must be paid in ETH and should be included in the msg.value when calling 
`createPool()`.

The base fee amount can be checked by calling `getBaseFee()`. At time of 
writing, the base fee is set to 0 ETH. 

### Percentage Fee
The percentage fee is determined by the amount of funding in the pool and is 
charged when the pool is funded. The fee will be deducted from the funding 
amount. 

For example, if `fundPool()` is called with 1 ETH as the amount, .025 ETH will 
be deducted from the amount as the fee. The remaining .975 ETH will be used to 
fund the pool.

The percentage fee amount can be checked by calling `getFeePercentage()`. At 
time of writing the percentage fee is 2.5%. 

### Fee Governance
Fee amounts are determined through the [Gitcoin DAO governance process](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v3/10358).
