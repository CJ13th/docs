# Auditing an Allocation Strategy

We highly recommend getting your allocation strategy audited by a professional
smart contract auditor. Allo was audited in a Sherlock contest
([leaderboard](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/109/leaderboard)). We
recommend the following auditors, because they scored highly in the audit
contest and are already familiar with the protocol.
