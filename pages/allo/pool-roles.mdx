# Pool Roles

`Allo.sol` exposes two roles for managing pools, a pool manager and a pool
admin.

## Pool Admin

When a pool is created, the admin is set to the value of `msg.sender` (the
caller of either method for creating a pool).

The primary function of the admin is adding and removing pool managers.

## Pool Manager

The pool manager has the ability to update the pool metadata using the 
`updatePoolMetadata` function.

Additional responsibilities can be granted to the pool manager in the pool 
strategy. For example, some strategies may wish to limit access to the 
`distribute` function to pool managers. The `BaseStrategy.sol` contract 
provides an 'onlyPoolManager` modifier that can be used to restrict functions.
