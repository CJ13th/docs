# Pool Roles
`Allo.sol` exposes two roles for managing pools, a pool manager and a pool admin.

When a pool is created the admin and manager are set to msg.sender.

## Pool Admin
The admin can reassign the pool manager using the `addPoolManager` and 
`removePoolManager` functions.

## Pool Manager
The pool manager has the ability to update the pool metadata using the 
`updatePoolMetadata` function.

Additional responsibilities can be granted to the pool manager in the pool 
strategy. For example, some strategies may wish to limit access to the 
`distribute` function to pool managers. The `BaseStrategy.sol` contract 
provides an 'onlyPoolManager` modifier that can be used to restrict functions.
