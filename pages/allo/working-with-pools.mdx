# Working with Pools

Technical guide for working with pools. Key things to cover are:
- creating a pool (both methods)
- how pools and allocation strategies work together
- the lifecycle of a pool

This page should include code snippets in JS for how to interact with these
methods

| `identityId` | `bytes32` | A unique ID for representing each pool |

| `token` | `address` | The token to be distributed |
