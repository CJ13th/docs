# Working with Pools
Pools handle the implemenataion of allocation and distribution strategies in 
Allo. While the details of the allocation and distribution are contained in the
strategy contract, those contracts should not be called directly. Instead, a 
pool will be created that links to the strategy.

Pool functions are contained in `Allo.sol` and an Allo proxy contract is 
available to to receive requests. This means that to allocate funds according
to the rules in a strategy you will call the `allocate` function in `Allo.sol` 
and provide the pool id.

## Pool Lifecycle
#### Before creating a pool
1. Create and deploy a custom strategy, or choose a clonable strategy.
2. Register on the Project registry.
3. Determine who the pool manager(s) will be.

#### Starting and Running a Pool
1. Use the `Allo.sol createPool` or `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` function to
initialize the pool. The pool can be funded during initialization, or at a 
later time using the `fundPool` function. See the code samples in Creating a 
Pool for more details.

2. Determine the recipients of the pool and add them using `registerRecipient`.
What data is required to register a recipient will depend on the underlying
strategy.
`Allo.sol` also provides `batchRegisterRecipient`, which will register a single
recipient to multiple pools.
Both functions return the `recipientId`, which will be needed for distributing
funds.

```
const tx = await alloProxyContract.registerRecipient(poolId, bytes(""));

const tx = await alloProxyContract.batchRegisterRecipient(poolIds, bytes[]);

```

3. When allowed by the strategy contract, have allocators allocate funds using
`allocate` or `batchAllocate`. `batchAllocate` is used to allocate funds to 
multiple pools and may not be available for all strategies.
The data required to allocate funds will be determined by the underlying 
strategy.
```
const tx = await alloProxyContract.allocate(poolId, bytes(""));

const tx = await alloProxyContract.batchAllocate(poolIds, bytes[]);

```


4. Once allocation is complete, complete distribution using `distribute`.
You will need the `recipientId` returned when they were registered. 
Again, specifics of how distribute will behave is determined by the strategy.

```
const tx = await alloProxyContract.distribute(
            poolId, recipientIds[], bytes("")
            );

const tx = await alloProxyContract.batchAllocate(poolIds, bytes[]);

```

5. If any funds are remaining after distribution, use `recoverFunds` to remove
them from the pool.
Only the poolOwner is allowed to use `recoverFunds`.
```
const tx = await alloProxyContract.recoverFunds(
            tokenAddress, recipientAddress
            );

```

## Creating a Pool
There are two methods available for creating a pool, `createPool` and `createPoolWithCustomStrategy`.

#### createPool
The `createPool` function should be used when you want to use a cloneable 
strategy from the Allo library. 
An error will occur if the strategy address provided is not approved as a 
cloneable strategy.
```
    const alloProxyContract = await ethers.getContractAt('Allo', alloProxyAddress, signer);

    const profileId = "registry profile id here";
    const strategyAddress = "cloneable strategy address";
    const initData = "0x";
    const tokenAddress = "0x7af963cf6d228e564e2a0aa0ddbf06210b38615d";     //Goerli test token
    const amount = 0;
    const metadata = {protocol: 1, pointer: "strategy pointer"};
    const managers = ["your wallet here"];

    const tx = await alloProxyContract.createPoolWithCustomStrategy(profileId, strategyAddress, initData, tokenAddress, amount, metadata, managers);
    await tx.wait();
    console.log(`Done! Transaction hash: ${tx.hash}`)
```

#### createPoolWithCustomStrategy
`createPoolWithCustomStrategy` can be used with, as the name suggests, custom 
strategies. The strategy must be deployed before the pool is created. 
```
    const alloProxyContract = await ethers.getContractAt('Allo', alloProxyAddress, signer);

    const profileId = "registry profile id here";
    const strategyAddress = "0x4AB4eF1aa0c2f63FFE77b245E679fb7B38681470";  //Donation Voting address
    const initData = "0x";
    const tokenAddress = "0x7af963cf6d228e564e2a0aa0ddbf06210b38615d";     //Goerli test token
    const amount = 0;
    const metadata = {protocol: 1, pointer: "strategy pointer"};
    const managers = ["your wallet here"];

    const tx = await alloProxyContract.createPoolWithCustomStrategy(profileId, strategyAddress, initData, tokenAddress, amount, metadata, managers);
    await tx.wait();
    console.log(`Done! Transaction hash: ${tx.hash}`)
```
