# Working with Pools
Pools handle the implemenataion of allocation and distribution strategies in 
Allo. While the details of the allocation and distribution are contained in the
strategy contract, those contracts should not be called directly. Instead, a 
pool will be created that links to the strategy.

Pool functions are contained in `Allo.sol` and an Allo proxy contract is 
available to to receive requests. This means that to allocate funds according
to the rules in a strategy you will call the `allocate` function in `Allo.sol` 
and provide the pool id.

## Pools, In-depth

Pools have a few important pieces of data to them:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `identityId` | `bytes32` | A unique ID for representing each pool |
| `strategy` | `IStrategy` | An allocation strategy |
| `token` | `address` | The token to be distributed |
| `amount` | `uint256` | The number of tokens to be distributed |
| `metadata` | `Metadata` | Offchain metadata for a pool |
| `managerRole` | `bytes32` | Bytes 32 string representing the OpenZeppelin role for managing the pool |
| `adminRole` | `bytes32` | Bytes 32 string representing the OpenZeppelin role for the admin of the pool |
